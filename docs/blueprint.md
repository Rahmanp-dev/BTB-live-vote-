## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark charcoal (#222222) for a modern, sophisticated feel appropriate to a stage event.
- Primary color: Electric purple (#BF5FFF) for CTAs and main UI elements, to make the voting selections 'pop'.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#D8B4FE) for subtle highlights and secondary interactive elements; complements the primary color.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, machined look. Use for headlines and body text.
- Use minimalist icons from 'Lucide' to represent different event and presenter categories; all icons to be filled, not outlined.
- Mobile-first design with a clear hierarchy; use rounded corners and generous spacing to create a smooth user experience.  Arrange options on screen so key selections appear tappable, 'chunky' and obvious.
- Subtle animations when switching presenters or submitting votes; use quick, elegant fades and transitions for a smooth user experience.
